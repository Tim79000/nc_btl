Ideas

Algae balls, marimo, could grow underwater and is peat for sponges???

Coeggulation, a ball made of eggcorns that can be pushed around like a Sokoban Box.

A gold counterpart for the mod, made of lode, lux?

Linen, new material for a new container, linen could also make fall damage less, well, damaging, dye-able?

Explosive, dangerous material, good for mining, but 75% of destroyed nodes don't drop anything except lode.

Trees grow different depending on elevation, pines, different seeds?

Puffball fungus? Ash flies everywhere? SPORES TOO!

Funnel, vertical shaft, rotatable? Linen for basketball nets?

Chromatic glass slight glow when near light to indicate translucent-ness?

Ropes, linen? Lode rod can be used as a zipline handlebar if enough velocity is applied, faster than sprinting, quicker movement, if ZipRunes are added, ZipRune cost will increase.

An entire new part of the tech-tree, hotter fires, industrial stuff, not replacing any old content while still using old content, sounded confusing, huh?

Salt, curing things, bacteria?

Giant idle nautiluses like the ones from the Sega Genesis classic "Ristar"?

Mortal form, a strange form shaped magical item you wear on your head that adds health to the game, mortal form is destroyed when you get enough damage, their should be a reason to use this, a strange ethereal substance
gets obtained?



Now for non ideas

Anything featured and other mods or in Warr's idea list. (except slabs)

Must fit the game.

Anything that makes the game a bit too easy, this is supposed to be a harsh game, made harsher with this mod. REMEMBER IF ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS, IT'S STILL REALLY YOUR FAULT.
